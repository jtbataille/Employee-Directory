# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Description
This application will allow users to view an entire employee directory at once so that managers and/or other employees can have quick access to non-sensitive information and data about other employees. Users may also filter these results by name.

## Installation
This application is deployed on [Heroku](#) for users to poke around and see how it functions.

Alternatively, users may clone this repository and use the following commands to make begin the application, entering them in an integrated terminal within the main directory:

* ```npm install express```
* ```npm install express-handlebars```
* ```npm install mysql```

After installing these packages to make sure the application functions, users should enter:

* ```node server.js```

This final command will make the app listen on the LocalHost PORT.

If following these commands, users should open their own browsers and go to the following address to see the deployed application:

> localhost:3000

## Technologies Used
React, JSX, Node JS, HTML, CSS, JavaScript

## Application Demo
After following the information in the [Installation](#installation) section above--database start within MySQL, navigating to the localhost, as well as running ```node server.js```---users will be greated with an opening page that looks like this:
